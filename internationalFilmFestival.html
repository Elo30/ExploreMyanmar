                <p>
                    A very special event is taking place in Yangon, Myanmar this year from October 28 to November 2, 2014. It is the very first Reprise of MEMORY! International Film Heritage Festival, a cinema event fully dedicated to the films of the past, unique in Asia.

                    The MEMORY! Festival was created in 2012 and two main editions took place in Cambodia in June 2013 and June 2014. The success of such an unusual event leaded us to organize a Reprise – meaning a selection of the 2014 programming around the theme of Laughter – in other countries. And we are delighted that Myanmar welcomes the very first Reprise.

                    The motivation for creating such an event dedicated to film heritage relies on the importance to preserve memory and enable access to this heritage.

                    Why ? Films are endangered everywhere in the world if they are not well preserved (notably by respecting humidity and heat control). Over 90% of films around the world made before 1929 are lost forever, as well as half of all American films made before 1950.

                    As films are part of the memory of a nation and humanity, they need to be taken care of. That means collecting them, searching for them when they are considered to be lost and preserving them in safe locations. Some films may benefit from a digitization and —for the few lucky ones— from a full restoration, but this is a long and expensive process. However all films should be looked after, no matter how they are minor or major works, fictions or documentaries, newsreel footage or rushes. This memory is a heritage of a nation and furthermore a world heritage. And future generations should be able to have access to it.

                    This is about old films. But films of the past have been - and still are - a source of inspiration for a multitude of filmmakers, whatever their nationality. And films of the past are an open window on the world for everyone whatever the latitude they live on.

                    Access to the films of past is generally an issue in most countries, despite the digital era. First issue : they are generally and structurally in danger and the time is their strongest enemy, allied to heat and humidity. They can be damaged, destroyed, lost or simply blocked for legal reasons. Secondly, films of the past are rarely accessible on large screen, which remains the best format to discover and appreciate a artistic work and enjoy fully the entertainment of such films.

                    MEMORY offers this selection in Yangon to enjoy 9 classics from around the world, around the theme of Laughter. From USA, Mongolia, France, Japan, UK…

                    It will last 6 days, with free admission for all.

                    Some of those films are blockbusters since their first release and went everywhere in the world since then. Some of them seldom left their own country. They are all treasures.

                    Through this MEMORY Reprise in Yangon, we propose a journey in the past. Up to those 9 films to take you away.

                    And you’d be surprised how modern and young those “old” films still are.
